# Unity Learning Project: Fakman (WebGL)
This is a project I took on in 2021 to learn Unity.
- This project tried to be a faithful Pacman Clone
- This was originally developed on Unity 2020.1.12f1 but has been updated to Unity 2020.3.12f1.
- This has only been tested on Windows.

## WebGL Differences
This webGL version strips out resolution settings and the ability to change the resolution.
The webGL version also removes all the exit buttons as they are not needed and would break the game if used.

## Notes:
- Although Astar is included in the project, I remember not using it.
- Pacman is controlled via WASD.
- The game may be buggy, as it was not extensively tested.

## Acknowledgements
- The original Pacman game and Pacman's likeness is owned by Bandai Namco Entertainment.
