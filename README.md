# Unity Learning Project: Fakman
This is a project I took on in 2021 to learn Unity.
- This project tried to be a faithful Pacman Clone
- This was originally developed on Unity 2020.1.12f1 but has been updated to Unity 2020.3.12f1.
- This has only been tested on Windows.

## Notes:
- Although Astar is included in the project, I remember not using it.
- Pacman is controlled via WASD.
- The game may be buggy, as it was not extensively tested.

## Acknowledgements
- The original Pacman game and Pacman's likeness is owned by Bandai Namco Entertainment.
